### Detailed Response

Got it—thanks for letting me know the current local time. It sounds like we've covered everything you need for now regarding your Git workflow, repository management, and open source attribution. All these insights—including handling remotes, documenting changes, and transitioning your work to a new repository—are well noted.

If you have any more questions or want to revisit any part of the process later, or if you'd like to explore a new topic, just let me know. I'm here to help whenever you're ready to continue.

Happy coding, and best of luck with your project!
