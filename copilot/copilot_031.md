Below are example wrapper files to support your enhanced workflow. We have:

1. **A Makefile** that defines:
   - A **gitup** target that automatically stages all changes, reads an incrementing commit number from a file (or environment variable), commits with a message like `"gitup 001"`, then updates that count.
   - A **clean** target that removes only the built files (in our case, the generated YAML files).

2. **A setenv.sh** file that exports environment variables used by your build process (with good defaults and documentation).

### Makefile

Save the following as a file named `Makefile` in your repository root. (Make sure to use literal tabs for command indents in the Makefile.)

```make
# Makefile
#
# This Makefile defines common build targets for this project.
#
# Targets:
#   gitup   - Automatically stages all changes, commits with an incrementing commit number,
#             and updates the commit count. The commit number is stored in the file $(GITUP_COUNT_FILE)
#             (default is commit_count.txt). You can override this with an environment variable.
#
#   clean   - Removes generated build files (YAML outputs); source code is preserved.
#
# Environment Variables (defined in setenv.sh):
#   FEKERR_YAML_CHECK  - If set to 1 (default), YAML lint checks will run.
#   GITUP_COUNT_FILE   - File where the gitup commit count is stored (default: commit_count.txt).

.PHONY: gitup clean

# Use environment variable GITUP_COUNT_FILE if set, or default to commit_count.txt.
GITUP_COUNT_FILE ?= commit_count.txt

gitup:
	@# Ensure the commit count file exists. If not, initialize it to 1.
	@if [ ! -f $(GITUP_COUNT_FILE) ]; then echo "1" > $(GITUP_COUNT_FILE); fi
	@commit_num=`cat $(GITUP_COUNT_FILE)`; \
	echo "Current gitup commit number: $$commit_num"; \
	git add .; \
	git commit -m "gitup $$commit_num" || echo "Nothing to commit"; \
	new_commit_num=`expr $$commit_num + 1`; \
	echo $$new_commit_num > $(GITUP_COUNT_FILE); \
	echo "Updated commit count to $$new_commit_num"

clean:
	@echo "Cleaning built files..."
	@rm -f output_2d_chunks.yaml output_3d_chunks.yaml
	@echo "Clean complete."
```

### setenv.sh

Create a file named `setenv.sh` in your repository. This script exports environment variables used for the build and linter checks. Feel free to modify the default values as needed.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setenv.sh
#
# This file defines environment variables used by the project.
# Source this file in your shell (e.g., "source setenv.sh") to set up your environment.
#
# Variables:
#
#   FEKERR_YAML_CHECK:
#       Controls YAML linting.
#       Set to 1 (default) to enable YAML lint checks.
#       Set to 0 to disable YAML linting during builds.
export FEKERR_YAML_CHECK=1

# GITUP_COUNT_FILE:
#       Specifies the file where the gitup target stores the commit count.
export GITUP_COUNT_FILE=commit_count.txt

# You can add more environment variables here as needed.
```

*Make sure to mark the script as executable if you plan to run it directly:*

```bash
chmod +x setenv.sh
```

---

### How to Use

1. **Set Up the Environment**

   - Before building, source your environment variables:
     ```bash
     source setenv.sh
     ```

2. **Run the Make Targets**

   - To automatically add/commit using the `gitup` target:
     ```bash
     make gitup
     ```
     This will run `git add .` and commit with a message like `"gitup 001"`, incrementing the commit count stored in `commit_count.txt`.

   - To remove generated build files (e.g., the YAML output files), run:
     ```bash
     make clean
     ```

3. **Build Process Integration**

   - These Makefile targets are independent of the Ninja build targets defined earlier. You can use both to orchestrate your environment and code management tasks.
   - In the future, you could extend these targets to integrate with container builds, additional linting, or performance metric collection.

---

### Summary

- **Makefile ("gitup" & "clean" targets):**
  - Automatically manages commits with an incrementing number (from a file or environment variable).
  - Defines a clean-up target that removes only built files.
- **setenv.sh:**
  - Centralizes configuration (e.g., for YAML lint checking and commit count file location) with good defaults and documentation.
  
This setup gives you a robust starting point for managing your build environment and source control actions in a reproducible manner. Let me know if youâ€™d like any further refinements or additional features!
