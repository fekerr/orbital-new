### Raw Prompt Input
```
ok - I need to create the new repo...

$ . new_repo_work.sh
ERROR: Repository not found.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

---

### Restated Input Prompt
You ran your script (`new_repo_work.sh`) to add a new remote and push your changes, but you encountered an error indicating that the repository was not found. The error suggests that either the repository `git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git` does not exist on GitHub, or you might not have the correct access rights.

---

### Detailed Response

The error you're seeing means that Git couldn't locate the remote repository specified in your `git remote add neworigin ...` command. Here's what's happening and how to resolve it:

1. **Repository Does Not Exist:**
   - The error `Repository not found.` tells you that GitHub has no repository at the URL `git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git`.
   - **Solution:** You need to create a new repository on GitHub with the exact name and under the correct account (in this case, it should be under your GitHub account `fekerr`).

2. **Steps to Create the New Repository on GitHub:**
   - **Log in:** Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
   - **New Repository:** Click the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
   - **Repository Name:** Name the repository exactly as you intend to use (for example, `orbital-new`).
   - **Settings:** Optionally add a description, decide if it should be public or private, and choose to initialize with a README if desired. However, if you're pushing from an existing local repository, you might want to leave it empty.
   - **Create:** Click "Create repository."

3. **Verify SSH Access:**
   - Since you're using an SSH URL (`git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git`), ensure that:
     - Your SSH key is added to your GitHub account.
     - The key is loaded in your SSH agent.
   - You can check SSH access with:
     ```bash
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```
   - If you see a message like "Hi fekerr! You've successfully authenticated..." then your SSH configuration is correct.

4. **Update and Re-run Your Script:**
   - Once the repository is created on GitHub, re-run your script:
     ```bash
     . new_repo_work.sh
     ```
   - This time, Git should successfully add the new remote and push your changes to the newly created repository.

### Next Steps

- **Documentation:**  
  Update your `work_history.md` or `new_repo_work.md` files with the creation details of your new repository. This documentation helps maintain history and attribution related to the changes made.

- **Review and Confirm:**  
  After pushing, check your GitHub account to ensure that the repository `orbital-new` now contains your code.
