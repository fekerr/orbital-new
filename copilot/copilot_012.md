### Raw Prompt Input
```
$ git remote -v
neworigin       git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git (fetch)
neworigin       git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:ThomasAFink/orbital-mechanics.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:ThomasAFink/orbital-mechanics.git (push)
```

### Restated Input Prompt
This output shows your Git remote configuration. You now have two remotes:
- **neworigin:** Points to your new repository at `git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git`.
- **origin:** Points to the original repository at `git@github.com:ThomasAFink/orbital-mechanics.git`.

---

### Detailed Response

Your Git remote configuration now includes two remotes:

1. **neworigin:**
   - **URL:** `git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git`
   - **Purpose:** This is your new repository. It represents the destination where you plan to push your radically altered version of the project. Since the new repository was created using the GitHub CLI (`gh`), and you’ve named this remote `"neworigin"`, it clearly differentiates your development work from the original upstream repository.
   - **Usage:** When you run commands like:
     ```bash
     git push neworigin main
     ```
     your local changes on the "main" branch will be pushed to this new repository.

2. **origin:**
   - **URL:** `git@github.com:ThomasAFink/orbital-mechanics.git`
   - **Purpose:** This remote is the original repository from which the project was cloned. Its existence ensures that you can, if needed, refer back to the original source or even pull updates (if applicable) from the upstream.
   - **Usage:** Commands like:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
     would interact with the original repository, though in your case, you're choosing to focus on the new repository for future changes.

### Next Steps and Recommendations

- **Verify Remotes:**  
  You've correctly set up the remotes. Confirm that you have the intended configuration by using:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
  which you've already done.

- **Working with Multiple Remotes:**  
  Since you have two distinct remotes, ensure that your workflow clearly distinguishes which remote you’re updating:
  - Use `neworigin` for pushing your future, radically modified code.
  - Keep `origin` intact if you wish to preserve the history of the original project.

- **Document Your Changes:**  
  As you continue evolving your project, make sure to add notes in your `work_history.md` or `new_repo_work.md` documenting:
  - The addition of `neworigin`
  - Your decision to push changes to your new repository
  - Attribution to the original `orbital-mechanics` repository

- **Pushing Changes:**  
  Now that the remotes are correctly set up, push your changes to your new repository if you haven't already:
  ```bash
  git push neworigin main
  ```

This clear separation helps maintain the open source conventions you described, preserving attribution and maintaining a distinct pathway for your innovative changes.
