Below is a complete, updated `build.ninja` file with the proper escaping for all shell variables. In particular, every `$` that should be passed literally to the shell is written as `$$`. This ensures that the implicit variable `$in` in the `check_yaml` rule is correctly expanded to the filename (for example, `output_2d_chunks.yaml` or `output_3d_chunks.yaml`), rather than an empty string.

> **Note:** Make sure to save and use this updated file so that when you run `ninja`, the YAML check commands receive the intended file names.

```ninja
# build.ninja
#
# This file defines build targets using Ninja for our project.
# It includes targets for:
#   - Installing required tools via install_tools.sh.
#   - Building YAML chunks from Python source files using python_to_yaml.py.
#   - Checking the generated YAML files using yamllint,
#     controlled by the environment variable FEKERR_YAML_CHECK.
#   - Executing auxiliary scripts (gitup.sh for auto-committing and clean.sh for cleaning built files).
#
# NOTE: Before running Ninja, run:
#       source setenv.sh
# to ensure that the necessary environment variables (e.g., FEKERR_YAML_CHECK, GITUP_COUNT_FILE) are set.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rule: Install required tools.
rule install_tools
  command = ./install_tools.sh
  description = Installing required tools (Ninja, yamllint, and PyYAML)

# Phony target for installing tools.
build install_tools: phony install_tools.sh

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rule: Build YAML chunks from a Python source file.
rule build_chunks
  command = python3 python_to_yaml.py $in $out
  description = Building YAML chunks from $in

# Targets to generate YAML chunks.
build output_2d_chunks.yaml: build_chunks ../inner_solar_system_more_action_2d.py
build output_3d_chunks.yaml: build_chunks ../complete_solar_system_3d.py

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rule: Check a YAML file using yamllint.
# All literal dollars are escaped as $$ so that the shell receives them correctly.
rule check_yaml
  command = bash -c 'file="$${in}"; echo "Linting file: $$file"; if [ "$${FEKERR_YAML_CHECK:-1}" -eq 1 ]; then yamllint "$$file"; else echo "YAML lint check skipped for $$file"; fi'
  description = "Checking YAML file $$in with yamllint"

# Targets to check the generated YAML files.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rule: Execute the gitup script (auto-commit with an incrementing number).
rule gitup
  command = ./gitup.sh
  description = Executing gitup (auto-commit with incrementing number)
build gitup: phony gitup.sh

# Rule: Execute the clean script to remove built files.
rule clean
  command = ./clean.sh
  description = Cleaning built files
build clean: phony clean.sh

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Phony target 'all' groups installation, build, YAML checking, and gitup tasks.
build all: phony install_tools output_2d_chunks.yaml output_3d_chunks.yaml yaml_check gitup

# Set the default target.
default all
```

### Things to Verify

1. **Existence of YAML Files:**  
   Ensure that the targets `output_2d_chunks.yaml` and `output_3d_chunks.yaml` are correctly generated by `python_to_yaml.py` before the YAML check rules run.

2. **Environment Variables:**  
   Before running `ninja`, remember to execute:
   ```bash
   source setenv.sh
   ```
   so that the environment variable `FEKERR_YAML_CHECK` is set.

3. **YAML Linter (yamllint):**  
   Make sure that `yamllint` is installed (which should be handled by your `install_tools.sh` script).

### Debugging Tip

The updated `check_yaml` rule now echoes the file it's about to lint:
- It will print a line similar to:
  ```
  Linting file: output_2d_chunks.yaml
  ```
  If you see an empty line after "Linting file:", this indicates that `$in` is not being passed correctly from Ninja to the rule. In that case, double-check that your build targets for `check_2d_yaml` and `check_3d_yaml` refer to the expected file names.

This complete file should resolve the `$`-escaping error so that the shell receives the correct file name, and your `yamllint` commands can process them. Let me know if you need further assistance or modifications!
