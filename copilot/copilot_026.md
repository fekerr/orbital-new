Below is a complete example of a `build.ninja` file that incorporates the "install tools" target as well as a sample target to build YAML chunks from a Python script. You can expand on this file as your project grows.

```ninja
# build.ninja
#
# This file defines build targets using Ninja.
# It includes:
# 1. An "install_tools" target that runs the install_tools.sh script to install Python dependencies (e.g., PyYAML).
# 2. A "build_chunks" target that uses the python_to_yaml.py script to convert a Python script into a YAML file.
# 3. A default "all" target that depends on both the above targets.

# Rule for installing required tools by executing install_tools.sh
rule install_tools
  command = ./install_tools.sh
  description = Installing required Python packages (PyYAML)

# Phony target to install tools; depends on the install_tools.sh script.
build install_tools: phony install_tools.sh

# Rule for building YAML chunks from a Python source file.
rule build_chunks
  command = python3 python_to_yaml.py $in $out
  description = Building YAML chunks from $in

# Example: Build target that converts a specified Python script to a YAML output file.
# Replace "../inner_solar_system_more_action_2d.py" and "output_chunks.yaml"
# with the appropriate input and output file names for your project.
build output_chunks.yaml: build_chunks ../inner_solar_system_more_action_2d.py

# Phony target "all" to group the targets for one-shot execution.
build all: phony install_tools output_chunks.yaml

# Set the default target so that running "ninja" builds everything.
default all
```

### Explanation

- **install_tools Rule and Target:**  
  - The `install_tools` rule runs the `install_tools.sh` script.
  - The build target `install_tools` is marked as phony with a dependency on the script (this means it will always run on demand).
  
- **build_chunks Rule and Target:**  
  - The `build_chunks` rule runs the `python_to_yaml.py` script with the input file (`$in`) and output YAML file (`$out`).
  - In this example, `output_chunks.yaml` is generated from `../inner_solar_system_more_action_2d.py`.
  
- **Phony "all" Target:**  
  - The `all` target depends on both `install_tools` and `output_chunks.yaml`, ensuring that both installation and building the chunks occur when you run `ninja`.
  - The `default all` statement sets this as the default target, so running just `ninja` will execute these steps.

You can now use Ninja to orchestrate your build process. For example, run:

```bash
ninja
```

This will trigger both the installation of tools via `install_tools.sh` and the generation of the YAML chunks. Let me know if you need additional targets or further modifications!
