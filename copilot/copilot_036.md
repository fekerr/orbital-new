Below is some guidance on how to change the behavior of Windows Terminal. Since your request is a bit open-ended, here are a few common approaches and tips to customize Windows Terminal’s behavior, including editing its settings file, using the built-in settings UI, and applying environment variable changes.

### 1. Modify the Settings File (settings.json)

Windows Terminal uses a JSON configuration file (usually named `settings.json`) to define profiles, keybindings, appearance, and startup behavior. You can edit this file to change many aspects of how the terminal behaves.

#### How to Open settings.json

- **Via the UI:**
  - Open Windows Terminal.
  - Click the down-arrow (∨) next to the plus tab.
  - Choose **Settings**. Modern versions of Windows Terminal provide a graphical settings UI that automatically edits `settings.json` behind the scenes.
- **Manually:**
  - The file is typically located at:
    ```
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json
    ```
  - Open it in your favorite text editor.

#### Example Changes

Here are a few examples of changes you might make:

- **Default Profile:**  
  Set the default profile to your preferred shell:
  ```json
  "defaultProfile": "{your-profile-guid-here}"
  ```
- **Startup Behavior:**  
  Change the startup command line or starting directory for a profile:
  ```json
  "profiles": {
      "list": [
          {
              "guid": "{your-profile-guid-here}",
              "name": "PowerShell",
              "commandline": "powershell.exe",
              "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
              "environment": {
                  "MY_CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
              }
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
- **Appearance and Key Bindings:**  
  Adjust the color scheme, font, or add custom key bindings.

### 2. Use the Visual Settings UI

Recent versions of Windows Terminal come with a visual settings editor that makes it easier to change these settings without manually editing JSON. Explore the options under the **Appearance**, **Profiles**, and **Actions** sections to change how the terminal looks and behaves.

### 3. Environment Variables and Startup Scripts

If you need specific environment variables to be set for your development, you can configure these in a profile’s `"environment"` section as shown above. This can be useful if you want every new terminal instance to have the same environment without manually sourcing files.

For example:
```json
"profiles": {
    "list": [
        {
            "guid": "{your-profile-guid}",
            "name": "Git Bash",
            "commandline": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe --login -i",
            "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
            "environment": {
                "FEKERR_YAML_CHECK": "1",
                "GITUP_COUNT_FILE": "commit_count.txt"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### 4. Considerations for Scripting and Container Integration

- **Scripting:**  
  Since you mentioned using wrapper scripts (in Bash or Python) to manage your build process, you can configure a Windows Terminal profile that automatically launches your build environment (for example, via WSL2 or Docker).
  
- **Docker Integration:**  
  If you run a Docker container that mounts your project and sets up your environment, you could configure a profile that runs a Docker command on startup, ensuring consistency.

---

### 5. Standard Approaches and Further Customization

- **Documentation and Examples:**  
  The [Windows Terminal documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) is very helpful for learning more about customizations. There are examples of complete `settings.json` files online that can give you more ideas.
  
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  As you change settings, test them out by opening new tabs and verifying the behavior. Keep notes on what works best for your workflow.

### Final Thoughts

Changing Windows Terminal’s behavior is primarily about configuring its `settings.json` file (or using the Visual Settings UI), adding any necessary environment variables, and adjusting startup commands to fit your workflow. If you have more specific behavior you’d like to change (such as key binding conflicts, performance tweaks, or automated environment loading), feel free to provide more details.
