### Raw Script Content

```bash
# Check current remotes:
git remote -v >> new_repo_work.md

# Add a new remote (e.g., "neworigin"):
# git remote add neworigin https://github.com/yourusername/orbital-new.git
git remote add neworigin git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git

# To push to the new remote:
# git push neworigin master
git push neworigin main
```

### Detailed Script Review

Below is a step-by-step review of your shell script with comments on what each section does and suggestions where applicable:

1. **Recording Current Remotes:**
   - **Command:** `git remote -v >> new_repo_work.md`
   - **Function:** Appends the output of the `git remote -v` command (which lists all configured remotes and their corresponding URLs) to the file `new_repo_work.md`.
   - **Purpose:** This is useful for maintaining a record of the current remote state before making any changes.
   - **Review:** This command is correctly placed and works as intended. You may want to add a header line or a timestamp to the file for better context if needed.

2. **Adding a New Remote:**
   - **Command:**  
     ```bash
     # git remote add neworigin https://github.com/yourusername/orbital-new.git
     git remote add neworigin git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git
     ```
   - **Function:** Adds a new remote repository alias called `neworigin` pointing to `git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git`.
   - **Purpose:** This sets up a secondary remote so that you can push your changes to a different repository.
   - **Review:** 
     - The commented-out line using the HTTPS URL serves as an example for alternate remote URLs. 
     - The uncommented command uses the SSH URL, which is likely preferred if you have SSH keys set up.
     - Ensure that you haven't already defined a remote with the same name (`neworigin`), as Git will throw an error if it already exists.

3. **Pushing to the New Remote:**
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     # git push neworigin master
     git push neworigin main
     ```
   - **Function:** Pushes your local branch to the new remote named `neworigin`.  
   - **Purpose:** This command copies your local repository state (commits on the branch) to the new remote repository.
   - **Review:**
     - The commented-out command shows an alternative command for pushing the "master" branch.
     - The uncommented command pushes the "main" branch, which is good if your repository's default branch is named "main" (this aligns with current GitHub conventions).
     - Ensure that the branch you want to push is indeed named "main" in your repository.

### Overall Comments

- The script is concise and clear.
- It documents your intentions using comments, making it easy to follow.
- Recording the remote configuration in `new_repo_work.md` is a useful practice for tracking changes.
- Before running, verify that you are on the intended branch (i.e., "main") and that the new remote name (`neworigin`) does not conflict with any existing remotes.
- To further enhance the script, consider adding error checking (e.g., verifying that the remote was added successfully before pushing) or logging with timestamps.

This script meets your needs for gradually making changes and retaining documentation of the remotes in use. Let me know if youâ€™d like to expand it further or have any more questions about Git workflows!
