### Raw Prompt Input
```
Ok, we're back.

I want to break up a large python script by putting it into sections in a yaml format. So I need a tool to take python and put it into yaml in "chunks".

Then I want enable-disable bits on each chunk of data or code. There can be a later optimization pass where an optimized python script is generated to be run.

There is data in the python script for objects in the solar system. It models their orbits.

I want to experiment with enabling or disabling each objects' "gravity" and have each object represented as a "cloud" of points, depending on what the gravity calculation provided.

I want each object to basically have "history" and "error bars".

I want to manage memory so not everything has to be present in memory at once.

I want lots of performance metrics gathered, and lots of logging.

Let's add this "prompt" to this morning's increment of the project. The timestamp here is approximately 20250315 0808 am

### Restated Input Prompt
You're looking to extend your project by developing a tool that transforms a large Python script into a YAML file by breaking it into manageable sections or “chunks.” Each chunk (which can represent either code or data) should support an enable/disable flag and later be reassembled (possibly in an optimized form) into a runnable Python script. The base Python script contains data modelling the orbits of solar system objects (with the associated gravity calculations). For each object, you want to experiment with toggling gravity, visualizing a “cloud” of points representing the orbital positions, and recording additional metadata like history and error bars. You also need to design the system in a memory-efficient way, log detailed performance metrics, and gather plenty of logging data.

The timestamp for this update is approximately 20250315 0808 am.

### Detailed Response

Below is an outline of a solution and accompanying code snippets that demonstrate how you might approach this task.

#### 1. Overview of the Approach

- **Chunking the Python Script into YAML:**
  - We will create a tool (written in Python) that reads a large Python script and divides it into “chunks” based on markers—either by detecting predefined markers inside the code (like `# --- CHUNK ---`) or by using fixed-size blocks.
  - Each chunk is then serialized into a YAML format. The YAML structure for each chunk might include:
    - A unique identifier (e.g., `chunk_id`)
    - The contents of the chunk (i.e., code or data)
    - A flag (e.g., `enabled: true/false`) to enable or disable that chunk
    - Optional metadata like performance metrics placeholders, history, and error bar info

- **Enabling/Disabling Chunks & Optimization:**
  - Later, you can read this YAML file and selectively enable or disable chunks. An "optimization pass" can then be applied to modify some of the code/data before reassembling the final runnable Python script.
  - This enables experimentation, such as disabling the gravity calculations per object or toggling the representation of an object’s location as a cloud of points.

- **Memory Management & Logging:**
  - The generated tool can include mechanisms to load only a subset of the chunks into memory at a time.
  - It can be instrumented with performance monitoring using Python’s `logging` and `time` modules, capturing metrics such as execution time per chunk.
  - You can optionally dump metrics into a separate log file or attach them in the YAML metadata.

#### 2. YAML Chunk Structure Example

Here’s an example of what a chunk in YAML might look like:

```yaml
# Example YAML representation for one chunk
- chunk_id: 001
  description: "Imports and initial setup"
  enabled: true
  content: |
    import math
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  metadata:
    performance: {}
    history: "Initial setup for environment."
    error_bars: null
```

For an orbit object definition with gravity toggling, a chunk might be:

```yaml
- chunk_id: 010
  description: "Define solar system object: Earth"
  enabled: true
  content: |
    class SolarSystemObject:
        def __init__(self, name, mass, position, velocity, gravity_enabled=True):
            self.name = name
            self.mass = mass
            self.position = position  # e.g. [x, y, z]
            self.velocity = velocity  # e.g. [vx, vy, vz]
            self.gravity_enabled = gravity_enabled
            self.history = []
            self.error_bars = None

        def compute_orbit(self):
            if self.gravity_enabled:
                # Perform gravity calculations
                # [simulate cloud of points]
                pass
            else:
                # Skip gravity effects
                pass
  metadata:
    performance: {}
    history: "Created Earth object with initial parameters."
    error_bars: "Not computed."
```

#### 3. Python Tool for Chunking

Here's a simplified Python script that implements the chunking mechanism. This script reads a Python file, breaks it into chunks using markers, and writes out a YAML file.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Tool: python_to_yaml_chunks.py

Purpose:
    - Read a large Python script.
    - Break it into chunks based on defined markers.
    - Write chunks into a YAML file with metadata.
    - Each chunk includes an 'enabled' flag.
    
Later, this YAML file can be edited (to enable/disable chunks)
and an optimized version can be generated from it.
"""

import yaml
import re
import sys
import os

def split_into_chunks(file_path, marker=r'# --- CHUNK ---'):
    """
    Splits the python file into chunks based on a marker.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the input Python script.
        marker (str): The regex pattern to use as a chunk delimiter.
    
    Returns:
        List[Dict]: A list of dicts each representing a chunk.
    """
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    chunk_id = 1
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            if re.search(marker, line):
                # Save the current chunk if any
                if current_chunk:
                    chunks.append({
                        'chunk_id': f'{chunk_id:03d}',
                        'description': f'Chunk {chunk_id}',
                        'enabled': True,
                        'content': ''.join(current_chunk),
                        'metadata': {
                            'performance': {},
                            'history': '',
                            'error_bars': None
                        }
                    })
                    chunk_id += 1
                    current_chunk = []
            else:
                current_chunk.append(line)
        # Append last chunk if present
        if current_chunk:
            chunks.append({
                'chunk_id': f'{chunk_id:03d}',
                'description': f'Chunk {chunk_id}',
                'enabled': True,
                'content': ''.join(current_chunk),
                'metadata': {
                    'performance': {},
                    'history': '',
                    'error_bars': None
                }
            })
    return chunks

def write_yaml(chunks, output_path):
    """
    Writes the chunks to a YAML file.
    
    Args:
        chunks (list): List of chunk dictionaries.
        output_path (str): The YAML file to write to.
    """
    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
        yaml.dump(chunks, f, sort_keys=False)

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python python_to_yaml_chunks.py <input_py_file> <output_yaml_file>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    input_file = sys.argv[1]
    output_file = sys.argv[2]
    
    if not os.path.isfile(input_file):
        print(f"Error: {input_file} does not exist.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    chunks = split_into_chunks(input_file)
    write_yaml(chunks, output_file)
    print(f"YAML chunks written to {output_file}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Usage Example:**

```bash
python python_to_yaml_chunks.py large_script.py chunks.yaml
```

This command will read `large_script.py`, split it into chunks wherever it finds `# --- CHUNK ---` markers, and then dump the result to `chunks.yaml`.

#### 4. Future Steps

- **Enable/Disable Chunks:**  
  You can later edit the YAML file (`chunks.yaml`), setting any chunk's `enabled` flag to `false` to disable that part when generating the final optimized script.
  
- **Optimized Python Script Generation:**  
  Create another tool that reads the YAML file, filters out disabled chunks, and concatenates the enabled chunks back into a single Python script. You could also include optimizations during reassembly.
  
- **Handling Large Data and Performance Logging:**  
  As you model solar system objects and simulate orbits, you may want to:
  - Load chunks on demand.
  - Log metrics using Python’s `logging` library.
  - Use generators or caching to manage memory usage.
  - Append performance data to each chunk’s metadata.

- **Experimentation with Gravity and Data Representation:**  
  Within each object's code chunk, you might add parameters that allow toggling gravity (e.g., modifying the `gravity_enabled` flag) and plotting a cloud of points. History and error bars may be updated dynamically during execution and then stored back into the YAML for analysis.
