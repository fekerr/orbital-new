This is what I have so far.

Let's work step by step.

### Restated Input Prompt
You have listed your current directory contents, which shows that you have successfully created the following files:
- **regex_utils.py** – Contains the regex utility functions.
- **python_to_yaml.py** – Your main script for converting Python code into YAML-formatted chunks.
- **test_regex_utils.py** – Unit tests for the regex utilities.

You’d like to proceed step by step with the process.

### Detailed Response

Your directory listing indicates that your project is coming together nicely. Here’s a breakdown of the current files and some recommended next steps:

1. **File Overview:**
   - **regex_utils.py (1,405 bytes):**  
     This file should contain every regex-related utility function, such as the `is_chunk_marker` and `is_blank_line` functions. We isolated this logic to enhance maintainability and to facilitate unit testing.
     
   - **python_to_yaml.py (5,663 bytes):**  
     This is your main Python script that breaks a large Python script into YAML “chunks.” It integrates both AST-based parsing and heuristic methods (e.g., detecting blank lines) via functions imported from `regex_utils.py`.
     
   - **test_regex_utils.py (1,041 bytes):**  
     This file contains unit tests to validate the regex functions in `regex_utils.py`. Running these tests will verify that the utility functions are operating correctly.

2. **Next Steps:**

   **a. Run the Unit Tests for Regex Utilities**
   
   Before moving on, you should run your unit tests to ensure that your regex utility functions behave as expected. In your terminal, you can run:
   
   ```bash
   python3 test_regex_utils.py
   ```
   
   If you see output indicating that all tests pass (e.g., “OK” or similar), then your regex utility module is working as intended. If any tests fail, review the test output to debug the issue.
   
   **b. Test the Main Script**
   
   Once the tests pass, try running the main script (`python_to_yaml.py`) with a small sample Python file to see how it splits the content into chunks. For instance:
   
   ```bash
   python3 python_to_yaml.py sample_script.py output_chunks.yaml
   ```
   
   This command should read `sample_script.py`, break it up automatically (using both AST and heuristic methods), and produce a YAML file named `output_chunks.yaml`. Inspect that file to verify that the chunks are logically separated.
   
   **c. Review and Document**
   
   As you work through these steps, it’s beneficial to document what each script does and how the build process works. Consider writing a short README or a section in your BUILD.md explaining:
   
   - The purpose of each file in this toolchain.
   - How to run the unit tests.
   - How to use `python_to_yaml.py` with example commands.
   - Future plans (e.g., enabling/disabling chunks, optimizations, performance logging, etc.).
   
   **d. Iterate Incrementally**
   
   Since you want to work step by step, start by verifying the unit tests, then the main script, and finally extend functionality (such as integrating Docker, Ninja, or additional performance logging if necessary).

3. **Standard Approaches and Best Practices:**
   - **Unit Testing:**  
     Isolating regex functionality in `regex_utils.py` and writing tests in `test_regex_utils.py` follows best practices for maintainable, robust code.
     
   - **Modularization:**  
     Separating your tool into a main script and utility modules (like the regex utilities) makes your code easier to manage and expand.
     
   - **Documentation:**  
     Documenting how the tool works and how users can run the individual components will be invaluable for onboarding new contributors or revisiting the project in the future.

### What Would You Like to Do Next?

- **Run Unit Tests:** Try running `python3 test_regex_utils.py` to ensure your regex utilities work.
- **Test Main Script:** Execute `python3 python_to_yaml.py <input_file> <output_yaml>` with a sample file and review the output.
- **Discuss Further Enhancements:** Let me know if you’d like to refine any functionality, or if you need help incorporating Docker/Ninja, setting up a build environment, or further documenting the process.

Feel free to share your test results or any questions as we proceed step by step!
