### Raw Prompt Input
```
checking a previous repo of mine...

cat: new_repo_work.md: No such file or directory
(venv) fekerr@LAPTOP-AJPE53SG:~/src/my_gpus$ . ../orbital-mechanics/new_repo_work.sh
(venv) fekerr@LAPTOP-AJPE53SG:~/src/my_gpus$ cat new_repo_work.md
origin  git@github.com:fekerr/my_gpus.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:fekerr/my_gpus.git (push)
(venv) fekerr@LAPTOP-AJPE53SG:~/src/my_gpus$
```

---

### Restated Input Prompt
You have executed the `new_repo_work.sh` script (located in `../orbital-mechanics/`) from your current repository (`my_gpus`). Initially, the file `new_repo_work.md` didn’t exist, but after sourcing the script, the file was created with output showing the current remote configuration for your repository (which now points to `git@github.com:fekerr/my_gpus.git` for both fetch and push). You’re checking to confirm the documentation was properly appended.

---

### Detailed Response

It looks like the script behaved as expected. Let’s break down what you observed and what it means:

1. **Initial Check:**  
   When you ran:
   ```
   cat new_repo_work.md
   ```
   you received the message:
   ```
   cat: new_repo_work.md: No such file or directory
   ```
   This indicates that the file `new_repo_work.md` didn't exist at that moment in your working directory. This is completely fine, as the purpose of your script is to create and append to this file.

2. **Executing the Script:**  
   You then sourced the shell script from its location in `../orbital-mechanics/` by running:
   ```
   . ../orbital-mechanics/new_repo_work.sh
   ```
   Sourcing the script executes its commands in the current shell, ensuring any output (in this case, the output of `git remote -v`) is appended to your `new_repo_work.md` file.

3. **Verifying the Output:**  
   After executing the script, running:
   ```
   cat new_repo_work.md
   ```
   now shows:
   ```
   origin  git@github.com:fekerr/my_gpus.git (fetch)
   origin  git@github.com:fekerr/my_gpus.git (push)
   ```
   This output confirms that:
   - The script successfully appended the current remote information to the file.
   - Your repository is configured with the remote named `origin` that points to `git@github.com:fekerr/my_gpus.git` (for both fetching and pushing).

### Significance

- **Documentation:**  
  This process serves as a record of your repository’s remote configuration at the time you made the changes. It’s especially useful when you’re planning to alter or add new remotes since you have a documented baseline.
  
- **Next Steps:**  
  Now that you've successfully recorded the current remote, you can proceed with the next stages:
  - **Optionally Add a New Remote:** Un-comment and execute the command to add a new remote (e.g., `neworigin`) if you decide to push to a separate repository.
  - **Push Changes:** Once the new remote is added, you can push your changes to it, again documenting the process by appending additional data to your `new_repo_work.md`.

### Considerations

- **Sourcing vs. Executing:**  
  Sourcing the script (using `.`) executes it in the current shell environment; this can be handy if you want to maintain the same environment variables or context.
  
- **Incremental Changes:**  
  By documenting each step (as you are doing with `new_repo_work.md`), you build a detailed work history. This is invaluable not only for your own understanding but also for maintaining proper attribution to the original work ("orbital-mechanics") and explaining your evolution of the project.

### Would You Like to Proceed?

If you're ready, the next step could be to un-comment and run the command to add a new remote, then update your documentation accordingly. Let me know if you’d like further guidance on that, or if you have additional questions about the process!
