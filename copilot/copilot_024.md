It looks like Python can’t find the `yaml` module because PyYAML isn’t installed in your environment. To fix this, you need to install PyYAML. You can do this using pip. For example, if you’re using Python 3, run:

```bash
pip3 install PyYAML
```

This will install the PyYAML library, which provides the `yaml` module required by your script.

After installing, try running your script again:

```bash
python3 python_to_yaml.py ../inner_solar_system_more_action_2d.py output_inner2d_chunks.yaml
```

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Let me know if you encounter any further issues or if you need additional help setting up the environment!
