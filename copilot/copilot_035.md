Below is an updated version of your `.gitignore` file that no longer ignores the YAML chunk output files. This way, files such as `output_2d_chunks.yaml` and `output_3d_chunks.yaml` will be tracked by Git and committed to the repository. This is useful for preserving your development process, documenting improvements, and making notes on how to "develop better" (including any observations related to overuse of Copilot).

### Updated .gitignore

```gitignore
# Ignore Python cache and bytecode files
__pycache__/
*.py[co]
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Do NOT ignore generated YAML chunk files; we want these committed.
#output_inner2d_chunks.yaml
#output_complete3d_chunks.yaml
#output_chunks.yaml
#output_2d_chunks.yaml
#output_3d_chunks.yaml

# Ignore Ninja build log
.ninja_log

# Ignore the commit count file used by the gitup script, if you don't want it tracked.
commit_count.txt

# Ignore temporary editor files and backups
*~
*.swp
*.swo
```

> **Note:** The lines for output YAML chunk files are commented out, meaning they will be committed. You can later adjust this file if you decide to ignore any other files.

### Summary

- **Output Files Kept:**  
  The YAML files (`output_2d_chunks.yaml` and `output_3d_chunks.yaml`) will now be tracked by Git. This allows you to document your development process and preserve a history of how your chunking functionality has evolved.

- **Documentation Purpose:**  
  Retaining these outputs can serve as a record of your experiments, including notes on how to "develop better" and what improvements might be made in the future (along with any observations you record on the usage of Copilot).

Feel free to modify the `.gitignore` further as needed, and let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust or add!
