```bash
#!/bin/bash
# new_repo_work.sh
# This script is used to manage Git remotes and push the local code
# to a new remote repository. It performs the following steps:
# 1. Lists current remotes associated with the repository.
# 2. Adds a new remote named "neworigin" which points to a specified GitHub URL.
# 3. Pushes the local master branch to the new remote.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1: Check current remotes.
# The 'git remote -v' command lists each remote linked to the repository,
# displaying both the fetch and push URLs. This helps you verify which
# remotes are already set and their corresponding URLs.
git remote -v

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2: Add a new remote.
# We add a new remote with the alias "neworigin". This name can be any
# identifier you choose, but it's common to use descriptive names.
# The URL provided (https://github.com/yourusername/orbital-new.git) should
# be replaced with the actual URL of your new remote repository.
# The syntax for adding a remote is: git remote add <name> <URL>
git remote add neworigin https://github.com/yourusername/orbital-new.git

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3: Push local changes to the new remote.
# The 'git push' command is used to transfer commits from your local repository
# to a remote repository. Here, 'neworigin' specifies the remote, and 'master'
# is the branch being pushed. If your main branch isn't named "master" (e.g., it might be "main"),
# adjust this command accordingly.
git push neworigin master
```

Each commented section above explains in detail what the command does, why it is used, and what you should expect. This should help clarify the purpose and function of each part of the script.
