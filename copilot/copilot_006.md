### Detailed Response

In Git, a **remote** is simply a pointer to another repository (usually hosted on a platform like GitHub) from which you can fetch or push changes. When you clone a repository, Git automatically sets up a remote called **origin** which points to the source repository you cloned from.

**"neworigin"** is just an arbitrary name you can choose when adding an additional remote. Here’s what it means and why you might use it:

1. **Naming Conventions for Remotes:**
   - The default remote name is **origin**.
   - When you want to connect to another repository (for instance, if you're planning to push your changes to a new repository that is not the original one), you can add a new remote with any name you choose.
   - In our case, we used the name **neworigin** to signify that this is a new remote destination, different from the existing **origin**.

2. **Purpose in Your Workflow:**
   - You cloned the original repository (orbital-mechanics) but now plan to push your changes to a different remote.
   - By adding a remote named **neworigin**, you create a separate link between your local repository and your new remote repository (for example, one you control or want to develop independently).
   - This way, you can continue working on your project while preserving the history and “roots” from the original, but avoid mixing the new work with the original remote’s push/pull operations.

3. **Flexibility and Clarity:**
   - The name **neworigin** is not a Git keyword—it’s simply a label. You could name it anything, like **myfork** or **devremote**.
   - Using **neworigin** helps clarify in your documentation which remote is the original (origin) and which is the new one where your radical changes will be pushed.

In summary, **"neworigin"** serves as a user-defined alias for a secondary remote repository. It distinguishes your new target for push operations from the initial remote (**origin**) associated with the cloned repository. This allows you to maintain a connection to the original code (for attribution and reference) while also developing an independently maintained version.

### Additional Insights

- **Adding a Remote:**
  When you run:
  ```bash
  git remote add neworigin https://github.com/yourusername/orbital-new.git
  ```
  you're instructing Git to remember that the alias **neworigin** should refer to the remote repository located at the specified URL.

- **Managing Multiple Remotes:**
  You can fetch from and push to multiple remotes by referring to them by name. For instance:
  - `git push origin master` pushes to the original repository.
  - `git push neworigin master` pushes to your newly added remote repository.

This naming flexibility is particularly useful if you're working on a fork or a derivative project where you want to keep both the original and your own repositories connected.
