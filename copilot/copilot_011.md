### Raw Prompt Input
```
$ gh repo create fekerr/orbital-new --public --source=. --remote=neworigin --push
✓ Created repository fekerr/orbital-new on GitHub
  https://github.com/fekerr/orbital-new
X Unable to add remote "neworigin"
```

---

### Restated Input Prompt
You've successfully created a new repository named `orbital-new` on GitHub using the GitHub CLI (`gh`), but when it attempts to add the new remote alias "neworigin" to your local repository, it fails with the error "Unable to add remote 'neworigin'". You need clarification on why this error might be occurring and how to resolve it.

---

### Detailed Response

The error message "Unable to add remote 'neworigin'" indicates that while the new repository was successfully created on GitHub, the GitHub CLI had a problem updating your local Git configuration to include a remote with the name "neworigin". This error typically occurs for one of the following reasons:

1. **Remote Already Exists:**  
   The most common cause is that your local repository already has a remote named "neworigin". When you run the command with the `--remote=neworigin` flag, `gh` is trying to add a remote with that alias. If one exists already, Git will refuse to add a duplicate.  
   **Solution:**  
   - **Check your remotes:**  
     Run:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
     This will list all currently configured remotes. If you see an entry for `neworigin`, that’s the reason for the failure.
   - **Remove the Existing Remote (if not needed):**  
     If you no longer need the existing `neworigin`, remove it with:
     ```bash
     git remote remove neworigin
     ```
     Then you can run the `gh` command again, or add the remote manually:
     ```bash
     git remote add neworigin git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git
     ```
     
2. **Permission or Configuration Issues:**  
   While less common, it's also possible that there might be permission issues or conflicts in your Git configuration. However, since you successfully created the repo on GitHub and are authenticated with `gh`, this is less likely.

3. **Using an Alternative Remote Name:**  
   If for some reason you prefer not to remove the existing remote (if it holds other relevant configurations), you can choose a different name for your new remote. For example, you might use:
   ```bash
   --remote=neworigin2
   ```
   and then re-run:
   ```bash
   gh repo create fekerr/orbital-new --public --source=. --remote=neworigin2 --push
   ```

---

### Next Steps

1. **Verify Existing Remotes:**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
     Look for any remote with the name "neworigin".

2. **Remove or Rename the Remote:**
   - If "neworigin" already exists and you don't need it, remove it:
     ```bash
     git remote remove neworigin
     ```
   - Alternatively, use a different remote name when creating the repo.

3. **Manually Add the Remote (if Necessary):**
   - If the `gh` command still cannot add the remote, you can manually add it:
     ```bash
     git remote add neworigin git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git
     ```
   - Then push your current branch:
     ```bash
     git push neworigin main
     ```

4. **Confirm the Change:**
   - Run `git remote -v` again to ensure "neworigin" now points to `git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git`.

---

### Summary

The error "Unable to add remote 'neworigin'" is typically due to an existing remote with the same name or a minor configuration issue. Checking your current remotes and either removing or renaming the conflicting entry should resolve the problem.
