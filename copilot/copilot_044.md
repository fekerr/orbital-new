Below is guidance on two complementary approaches to resolving the lint errors reported by yamllint:

1. **Include an Explicit Document Start in Your Generated YAML Files**  
   By default, PyYAML’s `yaml.dump()` does not insert a document start marker. You can fix the "missing document start" warning by changing the call to dump with the flag `explicit_start=True`.

   **For example, in your `python_to_yaml.py` file, update the YAML writing function:**

   ```python
   def write_yaml(chunks, output_path):
       """
       Writes the chunks to a YAML file.
       """
       with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
           # explicit_start=True forces what looks like a document start marker ('---') at the top.
           yaml.dump(chunks, f, sort_keys=False, explicit_start=True)
   ```

   This change will cause each generated YAML file to begin with a line containing `---`, which satisfies the document start requirement.

2. **Adjust the Maximum Line-Length Rule in Your Yamllint Configuration**  
   The errors about "line too long" are style issues. You have two main options:
   
   - **Option A:** Allow longer lines by disabling or relaxing the line-length rule.
   - **Option B:** Modify your YAML generation so that lines wrap suitably (although that is often more complex and less common).

   The typical approach is to provide a custom yamllint configuration file. Create a file named **`.yamllint`** in your repository root with content like:

   ```yaml
   extends: default

   rules:
     document-start:
       # This rule is now satisfied by explicit_start in PyYAML.
       level: warning
     line-length:
       max: 120  # Increase from 80 to 120 characters; adjust as desired
   ```

   This configuration tells yamllint to allow lines up to 120 characters and to treat any issues with document starts only as a warning (though if you fix it via explicit_start, you won’t see that issue).

---

### Next Steps

- **Update `python_to_yaml.py`:**  
  Add the `explicit_start=True` parameter to your `yaml.dump()` call so that each YAML file begins with `---`.

- **Add a `.yamllint` File:**  
  In your repository, add a `.yamllint` configuration file (as shown above) to relax the max line-length rule and adjust rule levels if desired.

- **Rerun Your Build:**  
  After making these changes, rerun your build. The log files from yamllint should no longer complain about the missing document start, and the line-length errors should be reduced or absent according to your settings.

This two-pronged approach ensures that your generated YAML is valid (with the proper document start marker) and that the linting rules are adjusted to fit your project's style.
