### Raw Prompt Input
```
where does " --- CHUNK ---" come from? I want this to be automated
```

### Restated Input Prompt
You're asking about the origin of the " --- CHUNK ---" marker used to split Python scripts into chunks and expressing a desire for a completely automated solution where the tool determines logical boundaries in the script without requiring you to manually insert these markers.

### Detailed Response

In the example we discussed, the marker `"--- CHUNK ---"` (typically written in a comment as `# --- CHUNK ---`) was used as a **manual delimiter** within your Python script. It serves as an explicit signal to the chunking tool that “here is where one chunk ends, and another begins.” This approach is simple and predictable but requires you to insert the marker manually into your code.

Since you want the process to be automated—without the need to sprinkle these explicit markers—the tool would need to analyze the Python script’s syntax to determine where to split the code into logical sections. Here are some approaches and considerations for achieving that:

1. **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Analysis:**
   - **How It Works:**  
     Use Python’s built-in `ast` module to parse the script and identify high-level constructs like module-level imports, function definitions, class definitions, and other significant code blocks.
   - **Automated Chunking:**  
     The tool could automatically assign chunk boundaries at each top-level statement or block (e.g., each function or class could become a separate chunk).
   - **Advantages:**  
     This method is much more robust and syntax-aware compared to manually defined markers.
   - **Implementation:**  
     You would write an AST walker that collects nodes and then serializes each group of nodes as a chunk, along with metadata (e.g., node type, starting line, etc.).

2. **Heuristics Based on Structure:**
   - **Line-Based Splitting:**  
     For very large scripts, you might decide to split the script every *N* lines or at empty lines that seem to naturally represent a pause in the code.
   - **Keyword-Based Splitting:**  
     Alternatively, you could combine heuristics (e.g., lines that start with `def `, `class `, or `if __name__ == '__main__':`) to determine suitable chunk boundaries.
   - **Maintainability:**  
     This approach can be simpler to implement but may not perfectly capture the logical structure of your code.

3. **Refactoring the Tool:**
   - Currently, the sample splitting function uses a regex to look for the explicit marker. To automate the detection:
     - Replace this regex-based detection with a function that uses `ast.parse()` on the file contents.
     - Walk the AST to extract code segments based on nodes (e.g., every top-level statement or function definition).
     - Organize these segments into chunks.
     - You can still use the YAML structure to store each chunk along with an enable/disable flag and metadata.
  
4. **Separation of Regex Code:**
   - If there is still need for any regex-based processing (for example, to detect inline comments or to split on minor patterns), keep that code isolated in a separate file (like `regex_utils.py`), with extensive inline documentation and accompanying unit tests. This improves maintainability and transparency.

### Summary

- The `"--- CHUNK ---"` marker in our earlier examples is a **manual delimiter** chosen for simplicity in demonstrating the concept.
- **Automating the splitting** of a Python script into chunks requires understanding its syntax, which is best achieved by parsing the script with the AST module or by using well-defined heuristics.
- This more automated approach will allow the tool to generate chunk boundaries without requiring manual insertion of markers.
- Meanwhile, any regex usage required for minor processing should be separated into a utility module (e.g., `regex_utils.py`) with comprehensive documentation and unit tests to ensure maintainability.

By moving to an AST-based or heuristic-driven chunking mechanism, you can fully automate the process and ensure that the chunks represent logical sections of your code. This fits well with your project's aims of enabling/disabling code parts, tracking performance, and later generating an optimized script.
