### Raw Prompt Input
```
I want to create the new repo using "gh" - it's currently authenticated to my repo
```

---

### Restated Input Prompt
You want to use the GitHub CLI tool (`gh`) to create your new repository directly on GitHub. Since you're already authenticated via `gh`, you can issue a command to create the repository, automatically set up a new remote (which you can call "neworigin"), and optionally push your current local branch. This process eliminates the need to manually create the repo on GitHub through the website.

---

### Detailed Response

You can create a new repository on GitHub using the `gh repo create` command. Given your current configuration, here’s a command that will do everything in one go:

```bash
gh repo create fekerr/orbital-new --public --source=. --remote=neworigin --push
```

**Explanation of the Flags:**

- **`fekerr/orbital-new`**:  
  This sets your new repository to be created under your GitHub account with the name `orbital-new`. Be sure to replace `fekerr` with your actual GitHub username if different.

- **`--public`**:  
  Creates the repository as public. Use `--private` if you prefer a private repository.

- **`--source=.`**:  
  Tells `gh` that the current directory (i.e., your local repository) is the source that should be published to the new repository.

- **`--remote=neworigin`**:  
  Sets the name of the remote in your local Git configuration to "neworigin". This is useful for distinguishing your new remote from the original "origin" (which points to the upstream repository, if applicable).

- **`--push`**:  
  Automatically pushes your current branch (typically "main") to the newly created repository.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Ensure You're in the Right Directory:**  
   Navigate to the repository directory where your changes exist.
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/orbital-mechanics
   ```

2. **Run the Command:**  
   Execute the command:
   ```bash
   gh repo create fekerr/orbital-new --public --source=. --remote=neworigin --push
   ```
   - This will create the new repository on GitHub.
   - The `gh` CLI will automatically set up the new remote with the alias "neworigin".
   - It then pushes your current branch to the new repository.

3. **Verify the New Remote:**  
   You can check that the new remote has been added by running:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should now see an entry for `neworigin` pointing to `git@github.com:fekerr/orbital-new.git`.

4. **Document the Change:**  
   Consider updating your `work_history.md` or `new_repo_work.md` file to note that the repository was created on GitHub using the GitHub CLI and that the new remote is now in use.

### Additional Notes

- **Authentication:**  
  Since `gh` is already authenticated, it will directly communicate with your GitHub account. If there are any issues (for example, if your SSH keys aren’t set up for GitHub), `gh` will prompt you or produce an error message.

- **Customizing the Command:**  
  If your default branch is not "main" (or if you prefer a different branch name), adjust accordingly. Also, for a private repository, change the flag to `--private`.

- **Interactive Mode:**  
  If you prefer a more interactive approach, you can run:
  ```bash
  gh repo create fekerr/orbital-new
  ```
  and follow the prompts, choosing the options for visibility, remote name, and push preferences.

### Final Command Recap

To create and set up your new repository with one command, run:

```bash
gh repo create fekerr/orbital-new --public --source=. --remote=neworigin --push
```

This command creates the new repository, sets up the remote alias "neworigin", and pushes your current code, all in one streamlined step.
