Below is some guidance on how to prevent your Windows Terminal from closing when a shell exits, so you don't lose context:

### 1. Modify the Windows Terminal Settings

Windows Terminal provides a setting called `"closeOnExit"` for each profile. By default, the terminal may close the tab when the shell process ends. You can change this behavior so that the terminal stays open even after the process exits.

#### Steps to Update:

1. **Open Windows Terminal Settings:**
   - Click the down-arrow (âˆ¨) next to the new tab button and select **Settings**.
   - This will open the settings UI or `settings.json` (depending on your version).

2. **Locate Your Profile:**
   - Find the profile you use (for example, Command Prompt, PowerShell, or your WSL/Bash profile).

3. **Set `closeOnExit` to `"never"`:**
   - In your profile's settings JSON, add (or update) the property:
     ```json
     "closeOnExit": "never"
     ```
   - This setting ensures that when the shell process terminates, the terminal tab remains open rather than closing immediately.

#### Example:

If you are using a PowerShell profile, your settings might look like this:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "list": [
      {
        "guid": "{your-profile-guid-here}",
        "name": "PowerShell",
        "commandline": "powershell.exe",
        "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
        "closeOnExit": "never",
        "environment": {
          "MY_CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "closeOnExit": "never",
  "defaultProfile": "{your-profile-guid-here}"
}
```

This ensures that even when a command (like running your wrapper or build scripts) finishes, the terminal stays open for you to review its output.

### 2. Alternative: Adding a "Hold" Option in Your Scripts

If you prefer not to change your global Windows Terminal settings, you can modify your wrapper scripts to pause at the end. For example, at the end of your Bash script, you can add:
```bash
read -p "Press Enter to exit..."
```
However, this is less flexible than configuring Windows Terminal directly, as it requires modifying every script where you want the delay.

### Final Thoughts

**Standard Practice:**  
Most users who want to preserve their terminal output set `"closeOnExit": "never"` in their Windows Terminal settings. This option gives you a consistent experience without having to modify individual scripts.

**Recommendation:**  
For development and debugging, update your Windows Terminal settings as shown above. This will ensure that when you run commands (via Ninja, wrapper scripts, etc.), you can always review the output without the terminal disappearing once the process completes.
