<yaml-chunks> #002:

### Raw Prompt Input
```
I want the tool to understand python syntax to some extent. If the parsing is done locally (and not by another tool), I want it to be very verbosely documented and straightforward code.

I don't believe regular expressions are easily maintainable. So all the regex code needs to be separated into a utility file, say, regex_utils.py. Also it needs to be extensively documented and unit tests need to be created.
```

---

### Restated Input Prompt
You wish to enhance the Python-to-YAML chunking tool so that it “understands” Python syntax to an extent. However, because you’re cautious about maintainability with regexes, you want any regex-related logic to be isolated in a separate utility file (named `regex_utils.py`). That module must be:

- Extensively documented,
- Kept straightforward,
- Accompanied by unit tests.

The idea is to keep the main tool clean while encapsulating and testing all the regex parsing code separately.

---

### Detailed Response

Below is a refactored solution that separates the regex logic into a dedicated file `regex_utils.py`. The main tool (`python_to_yaml_chunks.py`) then uses functions from `regex_utils.py` to detect chunk markers in the Python script. In addition, a unit test file (`test_regex_utils.py`) is provided for the regex utilities.

---

#### 1. `regex_utils.py`

This module contains our regex helper function. It is designed to check if a given line is a chunk marker (using a specified pattern). All regex‐related code is isolated here with extensive inline documentation.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
regex_utils.py

This module includes utility functions for handling regular expressions in our project.
We use these functions to detect chunk markers in Python scripts. By isolating regex logic
in this module, we enhance maintainability, readability, and enable targeted unit testing.

Functions:
    - is_chunk_marker(line: str, marker_pattern: str) -> bool
        Checks if a given line matches the specified marker pattern.
"""

import re

def is_chunk_marker(line: str, marker_pattern: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether the provided line qualifies as a chunk marker based on a regex pattern.
    
    Parameters:
        line (str): A string representing a single line from a Python script.
        marker_pattern (str): A regex pattern used to identify the chunk marker.
            For example, r'# --- CHUNK ---'
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the line matches the marker pattern; otherwise, False.
    
    This function compiles the given pattern and checks if there is a match anywhere
    in the line. This abstraction is designed to keep the main chunking code clean and
    focused, while all regex complexities reside in this module.
    """
    # Compile the regex pattern.
    pattern = re.compile(marker_pattern)
    
    # Search for the pattern in the given line.
    match = pattern.search(line)
    
    # Return True if a match is found, else False.
    return bool(match)
```

#### 2. `python_to_yaml_chunks.py`

This is the main tool that reads a large Python script, splits it into chunks, and writes the chunks to a YAML file. It now imports and uses the `is_chunk_marker` function from `regex_utils.py` for marker detection. The code is extensively commented to explain each step.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Tool: python_to_yaml_chunks.py

Purpose:
    - Read a large Python script.
    - Break it into manageable chunks using a defined marker.
    - Serialize these chunks into a YAML file with additional metadata.
    - Allow future processing such as selectively enabling/disabling chunks or optimization.

The tool leverages regex_utils.py for detecting chunk markers, thereby isolating all
regex-related code for maintainability and testing.

def split_into_chunks(file_path, marker=r'# --- CHUNK ---'):
    """
    Splits a Python file into chunks using a specified chunk marker.
    
    Parameters:
        file_path (str): The path to the Python script to be split.
        marker (str): The regex pattern identifying a chunk delimiter.
    
    Returns:
        List[Dict]: A list of dictionaries, each representing a chunk with:
            - chunk_id: A unique identifier for the chunk.
