### Raw Prompt Input
```
I cloned a repo instead of making a fork first
actually I need to review git / GitHub / open source -- conventions
I've made a bunch of changes and want to push to a different remote - I won't be making a PR to the original repo
I do want to retain attribution, so let's add that to a work_history.md file

this is picking up work previously done to a clone of "orbital-mechanics" but I'm going to radically change the code, but keep the "roots" :)
```

### Restated Input Prompt
You’ve cloned a repository ("orbital-mechanics") instead of forking it, made significant changes, and now wish to push your work to a different remote—without creating a pull request to the original project. At the same time, you want to retain attribution to the original work (the "roots"), so you're planning to document that history in a `work_history.md` file.

You also want to review Git, GitHub, and open source conventions, including best practices for attribution when deriving new projects. Let’s discuss these conventions and outline some steps and considerations, including a template for your `work_history.md`.

### Detailed Response

#### **1. Git, GitHub, and Open Source Conventions**

- **Forking vs. Cloning:**  
  When you plan to contribute back (e.g., via a Pull Request, or plan to build on someone else's work) the GitHub convention is to fork the repository. Forking on GitHub creates a personal copy on your GitHub account, preserving the link to the original project and making it easier to contribute upstream.  
  - **Your scenario:** Since you cloned instead of forking and now want to push to a different remote (perhaps under your own namespace), you must ensure that the lineage is clear.

- **Attribution:**  
  Proper attribution is a cornerstone of open source ethics. If you're basing your work on the "orbital-mechanics" repository, you should:  
  - **Document the origin:** Adding a `work_history.md` file (or enhancing your `README.md`) to explain that your project originated as a clone of "orbital-mechanics."  
  - **Cite the original repo and its license:** Make sure to include links and citations if the original project is open source (and check its license to ensure compliance).
  - **Retain commit history when possible:** If you initially cloned the repository, the commit history is available—this is another form of attribution. However, if you plan to radically change the code, preserving a written record in a documentation file is valuable.

- **Pushing to a Different Remote:**  
  You can add or set a new remote using Git commands without affecting your local commit history. This allows you to "branch out" of the original project and continue development separately.
  
    For example:
    ```bash
    # Check current remotes:
    git remote -v
      
    # Add a new remote (e.g., "neworigin"):
    git remote add neworigin https://github.com/yourusername/orbital-new.git
      
    # To push to the new remote:
    git push neworigin master
    ```
  
  This keeps your work separate from the original repository.

#### **2. Creating a Work History and Attribution File**

A `work_history.md` file can document the journey of your project. Here’s a simple template you might use:

```markdown
# Work History and Attribution

## Origin
- **Repository:** [orbital-mechanics](https://github.com/original/orbital-mechanics)
- **Initial Clone Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **License:** (Include license information from the original repo)

## Motivation and Changes
- Cloned "orbital-mechanics" to explore its codebase and functionality.
- Made significant modifications to refactor and radically change the code.
- The goal of these changes is to evolve the project while keeping the foundational ideas.

## Attribution
- Many initial design and implementation ideas come from the original "orbital-mechanics" project.
- Special thanks to the original authors: (List author names or links here if available)
- The original work is licensed under: (Include the license details)

## Future Direction
- This project, now hosted at [Your New Repo URL], builds upon the roots of "orbital-mechanics".
- It will continue to respect and document contributions from the original project.
```

### Additional Best Practices

- **Commit Messages and Documentation:**  
  Ensure that significant changes are documented in commit messages. This helps prove the lineage of the code and shows how the project evolved over time.
  
- **Licensing Considerations:**  
  Review the original repository’s license carefully. Some licenses require that derivative works also include the same license or attribution notices.

- **Branching Strategy:**  
  Even if you’re not contributing a PR upstream, consider organizing your changes using branches on your new repository. This can help segregate legacy code from new modifications and make it easier to document the evolution.

- **Community Questions:**  
  Open source convention discussions often pop up on forums (e.g., GitHub Discussions, Stack Overflow) if you need to clarify further questions about attribution or migration practices.

### References, URLs, and Follow-Up Topics

- **GitHub Help on Forking:** [GitHub: Fork a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- **Attribution Best Practices:** Various open source guides recommend clear citation and documentation (e.g., [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)).
- **Git Remote Management:** Look up `git remote` commands in the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote).

This approach ensures that you’ve maintained ethical open source practices by clearly attributing the source of your work while transitioning to your own development stream with a new remote. Does this align with what you have in mind, or would you like to further refine any of these steps?
