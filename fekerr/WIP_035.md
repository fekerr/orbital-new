# WIP_035.md - Work In Progress Documentation (Version 035)

## Overview

This project is focused on breaking a large Python script into YAML-formatted chunks. We are using a mix of AST-based parsing and heuristics (such as detecting blank lines) to split the code into manageable sections. The build system is orchestrated via Ninja and supplemented with wrapper scripts that handle tool installation, git automation (gitup), and cleaning up built files.

## Components Completed So Far

- **regex_utils.py**:  
  Contains utility functions that encapsulate regular expression logic for detecting chunk markers and blank lines. This module is extensively documented and has associated unit tests.

- **python_to_yaml.py**:  
  The main script that converts a Python script into YAML chunks. It uses a combination of AST parsing and heuristics.

- **test_regex_utils.py**:  
  Unit tests for the regex utilities to ensure correct behavior and maintainability.

- **install_tools.sh**:  
  A Bash script that installs required tools:
  - Installs Ninja (using apt-get if not already present).
  - Installs yamllint (via pip3).
  - Upgrades pip and installs PyYAML.

- **gitup.sh**:  
  Automates Git commits by staging all changes, committing with a message of the form `gitup <incrementing number>`, and updating the commit count stored in a file.

- **clean.sh**:  
  Removes generated build files (such as the YAML output files) — leaving the source code intact since Git serves as our backup.

- **setenv.sh**:  
  A shell script to export necessary environment variables (e.g., for YAML linting and tracking the commit count).  
  **IMPORTANT:** This file is intended to be sourced, not executed directly. Run it using:  
  `source setenv.sh`

- **build.ninja**:  
  The Ninja build file that defines targets for:
  - Installing tools.
  - Building YAML chunks (for both 2D and 3D scripts).
  - Running YAML lint checks conditionally (controlled by the environment variable `FEKERR_YAML_CHECK`).
  - Running the auxiliary gitup and clean scripts.

- **Dockerfile**:  
  Defines a containerized build environment which uses `install_tools.sh` so that the container replicates the host build environment (automatically installing Ninja, yamllint, and PyYAML).

## Task List for Next Steps

1. **YAML Processing Enhancements:**
   - Refine the AST-based extraction in `python_to_yaml.py` to automatically create an "imports section" that consolidates all import statements.
   - Revisit and optimize the YAML parsing logic—possibly exploring alternatives (e.g., JSON or TOML) if needed for strict schema validation.

2. **Performance & Logging:**
   - Integrate performance metrics gathering (e.g., timing and memory measurements) into the YAML chunking process.
   - Add detailed logging mechanisms to track processing at the chunk level, with error bars and historical logs for each object modeled (like in the solar system simulation).

3. **Automated Diagramming:**
   - Investigate tools (such as Graphviz or Mermaid) that can automatically generate diagrams of code structure, data flow, and control flow from the AST.
   - Develop a prototype to automatically document the orbital mechanics code’s architecture (both the original and the refactored versions).

4. **Testing & Continuous Integration:**
   - Expand unit tests for both the AST parsing and YAML generation components.
   - Integrate automated YAML linting checks into a CI pipeline.
   - Consider exploring additional Git backup mechanisms if needed.

5. **Container Build Enhancements:**
   - Finalize the Dockerfile and possibly set up Docker Compose if multiple services/containers become necessary.
   - Ensure that `setenv.sh` and the installation scripts work seamlessly within the container environment.

6. **Documentation & User Guidance:**
   - Update README/BUILD.md with clear instructions on how to set up and use the build environment, including the use of Ninja, Docker, and wrapper scripts.
   - Document the process of running `source setenv.sh` before any build steps.

## Final Remarks

The current structure provides a robust baseline for an advanced build and development workflow. By incrementally enhancing YAML processing, integrating performance logging, and automating diagramming, we aim to develop a highly modular and maintainable system for future orbital mechanics experiments.
